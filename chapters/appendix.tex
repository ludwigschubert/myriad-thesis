\insertfigure{figures/uml_class_diagram_01.pdf}{The first stable UML Diagram from January \nth{24} still had separate \code{Email} and \code{contacts\_messages} tables, no rule automation and a semantically incomplete model of Emails which didn't discern between user generated emails and system generated emails.}{UMLDiagram01}{1}

\insertfigure{figures/uml_class_diagram_02.pdf}{The second UML Diagram from May \nth{28} fixed most of the aforementioned problems and already introduced optimizations such as extracting the RawMail content to a different table. Those had become necessary when support for attachments was introduced.}{UMLDiagram02}{0.75}

\insertfigure{figures/uml_class_diagram_03.pdf}{This third UML Diagram from May \nth{29} finally tamed the \code{Email} inheritance tree, and also introduced improvements to legibility for the first time.}{UMLDiagram03}{1}

\insertfigure{figures/uml_class_diagram_04.pdf}{By the time of this fourth UML Diagram from April \nth{18} only minor improvements were still made to the system design, such as adding \code{ValueSettingAction}s and supporting assistants via \code{SharingAssignment}s.}{UMLDiagram04}{1}
