This thesis introduces the myriad system for email mass communication.

Despite it's age, Email has remained the prevalent form of electronic communication, it's usage being wildly different from how it was imagined. The tools to handle it, however, are still stuck in their original UI metaphors.

Myriad aims at producing personalized communication on a comparable level to manually composed messages, while reducing user effort.
A cross-over of mailmerge and customer support/helpdesk software, it enables managing big volumes of bidirectional email-based communication.
It is based on a self-developed framework for separating information extraction, decision- making, and personalization steps in communication.

The myriad system consists of a server component that handles interfacing with email servers, a core logic system and a web frontend for users.

It can be tested at \url{http://myriad.ludwigschubert.de}.
